## Git and GitHub

1. Describe your impressions about learned materials.
	So i finished udacity git courses and learngitbranching.js.org, the last was quite easy and with course tasks i maybe had some troubles, but in the end nothing complicated.
	I'm far from mastering git, but it will come later in practice.

Interesting course, bit more complicated at the end - had some troubles with scripting, so i used hints. Everything was new to me and i was surprised of how powerful and useful comand line can be.

## Git Collaboration

Another great course that fill in some blanks, for example introduction of the features of git rebase command was super helpful.
