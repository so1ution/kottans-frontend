## Git and GitHub

1. Describe your impressions about learned materials.
	So i finished udacity git courses and learngitbranching.js.org, the last was quite easy and with course tasks i maybe had some troubles, but in the end nothing complicated.
	I'm far from mastering git, but it will come later in practice.
